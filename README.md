## Thought Process

This project was intimidating at first - I thought I would have to implement a bit of everything that I have learned up to this point: function parameters, objects, objects in arrays etc. 

It ended up being quite simple though, only taking place in a single function without having to implement the use of any of the above. I simply stored the value of the input field into a variable, and used that with each of the conversions, tying the result to another variable. I then used these 6 variables within 3 different template strings to display the results in the `innerText`s of each `p` element. 

I do wonder if it would be possible to implement the use of objects though - even if it makes it unneccessarily complicated, I think it would be good practice. I may come back to this project just to try this.
